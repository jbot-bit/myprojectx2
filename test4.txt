CRITICAL FIX — EDGE BACKTEST ENGINE IS INCOMPLETE

Finding:
Phase 3 tested ONLY baseline ORB outcomes from daily_features_v2.
Candidate-specific logic (RR, SL mode, filters, extended windows, bias) was NOT applied.
Therefore Phase 3 results are invalid for edge evaluation.

Task:
1. STOP using precomputed ORB outcomes for edge testing.
2. Build / use a backtest path that:
   - Iterates raw bars_1m
   - Detects ORB formation
   - Applies EACH candidate’s:
     - entry rule
     - stop rule
     - RR
     - scan window (including extended to 09:00 where specified)
     - filters (size, bias, compression, etc.)
3. Re-test ONLY these edges first:
   - 2300 ORB extended window (HALF SL)
   - 0030 ORB extended window (HALF SL)
4. Output:
   - trades
   - win_rate
   - avg_r
   - time-to-resolution
   - comparison vs baseline short-window ORB
5. Do NOT touch validated_setups or config.py.

Goal:
Prove that extended-window logic is the source of profitability and unlock promotion.
