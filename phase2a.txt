NEXT TASK: Fix pytest collection so `pytest -q` runs clean.

Current problem:
- `pytest -q` fails during collection due to duplicate test_app_sync.py, missing ml_inference module, legacy tests importing missing modules/functions.

Rules:
- Only tests under /tests are collected by pytest.
- Root scripts like test_app_sync.py are NOT pytest tests (manual verification only).
- Archived/legacy tests must not be collected.

Implement (minimal):
1) Add a pytest.ini in repo root with:
   [pytest]
   testpaths = tests
   python_files = test_*.py
   norecursedirs = _archive strategies pipeline data docs trading_app
   addopts = -q

2) Resolve the duplicate module name collision:
   - strategies/test_app_sync.py must be renamed or moved to _archive (do not delete).
   - Root test_app_sync.py remains as manual script (not collected due to testpaths).

3) Deal with legacy failing tests inside /tests:
   - For tests that depend on missing modules (ml_inference*, night_orbs_full_sl), either:
     a) move them to _archive/, OR
     b) mark them skipped with pytest.skip + reason at import-time
   Choose the simplest to make `pytest -q` pass.

Constraints:
- Do NOT change Trade Mode or AI Source Lock logic.
- Do NOT remove important functionality; just stop pytest from collecting dead tests.
- Stop and report after `pytest -q` passes.

Deliverable:
- Run command: `pytest -q` must complete with no collection errors.
- List all moved/renamed files and why.
