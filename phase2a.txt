You are Claude Code operating on my local machine.

CRITICAL CONTEXT
There is a VERIFIED discrepancy:

- validated_setups claims:
  - 2300 ORB Extended: +0.403R
  - 0030 ORB Extended: +0.254R
- All current backtests (baseline + proper engine) show NEGATIVE results
- ORB calculation itself is VERIFIED CORRECT
- Therefore: the positive results MUST have come from additional FILTERS / LOGIC
  that are NOT currently applied.

These filters/logics were implemented in OLDER project folders and are missing now.

TARGET DIRECTORIES (MUST SCAN ALL):
- C:\Users\sydne\OneDrive\MYPROJECTX2
- C:\Users\sydne\OneDrive\MYPROJECTX2 - COPY

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE
Find, extract, and reconstruct the EXACT filters / rules / logic that:
- were applied to 2300 / 0030 ORBs
- materially increased expectancy
- explain the +0.403R / +0.254R results

This is a forensic recovery task.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
- DO NOT assume results are wrong.
- DO NOT invalidate validated_setups yet.
- ASSUME the edge logic existed and was later lost.
- ZERO lookahead only.
- If logic is ambiguous, document hypotheses clearly.

STEP 1 — FULL FORENSIC SCAN
Recursively scan BOTH directories for files containing ANY of:
- "2300"
- "0030"
- "NIGHT"
- "OVERNIGHT"
- "EXTENDED"
- "FILTER"
- "WINDOW"
- "SESSION"
- "ASIA"
- "LIQUIDITY"
- "SWEEP"
- "REJECTION"
- "FADE"
- "BIAS"
- "ORB_SIZE"
- "VOLATILITY"
- "RANGE"
- "CONDITION"
- "GATE"

Include:
- .py
- .md
- .txt
- .csv
- notebooks if present

Produce a TABLE:
[file_path | file_type | purpose | relevant logic found]

STEP 2 — EXTRACT ALL FILTERS
From the discovered files, extract **every filter or modifier** that could affect results, including but not limited to:

- ORB size bounds
- volatility regimes
- time-of-day constraints
- minimum closes outside ORB
- delay before entry
- rejection confirmation
- session dependency (Asia → London → NY)
- sweep + fade logic
- bias alignment
- partial-day exclusion
- range compression / expansion filters
- trade invalidation rules

For EACH filter:
- exact condition
- when it is evaluated (timestamp)
- what trades it removes
- whether it is zero-lookahead compliant

STEP 3 — MAP FILTERS → PERFORMANCE
For each discovered filter:
- Explain qualitatively WHY it improves expectancy
- Identify which session(s) it applies to
- Mark relevance to:
  - 2300 ORB
  - 0030 ORB
  - both

Build a “MOST LIKELY MISSING FILTER SET” that explains:
- why baseline is negative
- why filtered result is strongly positive

STEP 4 — RECONSTRUCT PHASE 2 LOGIC
Using the recovered filters, reconstruct the most plausible Phase 2 rule set:

Example output format (DO NOT GUESS — INFER FROM FILES):

2300 ORB EXTENDED — RECONSTRUCTED
- ORB: 23:00–23:05
- Scan: 23:05 → 09:00
- Entry: first close outside ORB AFTER X condition
- Filters:
  - ORB size between A–B %
  - Asia range compression < C
  - Minimum N closes outside
  - No counter-sweep before entry
- SL: HALF
- RR: 1.5
- Exit: TP/SL or 09:00

Same for 0030.

STEP 5 — VALIDATION PLAN
Produce a concrete plan to:
- re-apply ONLY the recovered filters
- rerun backtest
- confirm whether results converge toward:
  +0.403R (2300)
  +0.254R (0030)

If convergence occurs → validated_setups is CONFIRMED
If not → identify exactly which assumption breaks

STOP CONDITIONS
- Do NOT promote, delete, or modify validated_setups.
- Do NOT change config.py.
- End by reporting findings + reconstructed logic + next action.

THIS TASK IS ABOUT RECOVERING LOST EDGE LOGIC — NOT BUILDING NEW EDGES.
