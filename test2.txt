PHASE 2 — VERIFICATION

Scope:
- Verify the 8 candidate edges from PHASE 1
- Re-scan the 20 liquidity-related files already identified

STRICT RULES:
- Do NOT backtest
- Do NOT invent new edges
- Do NOT approve anything
- Do NOT modify production code

For EACH candidate edge:
1. Explicitly list:
   - Entry timestamp
   - All data inputs used
   - Latest timestamp of each input
2. Confirm:
   - Zero lookahead (PASS / FAIL)
   - Required fields exist in daily_features_v2 (YES / NO)
3. Output a verdict:
   - PASS → eligible for Phase 3 testing
   - FAIL → discard
   - NEEDS REWRITE → specify exactly what must change

Liquidity file check:
- Re-check the 20 files containing:
  liquidity / sweep / absorption / rejection / fade
- Classify each as:
  SAFE / TAINTED / DOC-ONLY
- If TAINTED, state the exact lookahead issue.

Final output:
- Table of 8 edges with PASS/FAIL status
- Short list of edges allowed to proceed to PHASE 3
- List of tainted liquidity logic (if any)

STOP after verification.
