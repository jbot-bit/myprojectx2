## 🔥 KEY FINDINGS

### 1. **10AM IS THE KING** (3x better than 9am)

- **Best overall setup**: 10AM 6R FULL extended
- **50R per year** (vs 15R for best 9am)
- Uses FULL stops (opposite of 9am)
- 258 trades per year = **5 trades per week**

### 2. **11AM IS SECOND BEST** (2x better than 9am)

- **Best 11AM setup**: 3R HALF extended
- **32R per year**
- Uses HALF stops (like 9am)
- 28% win rate (highest of all three)
- Lower RR targets work better (2R-4R sweet spot)

### 3. **9AM IS WEAKEST** (but still works)

- Best setup: 8R HALF extended
- 15R per year
- Needs high RR targets (6R-8R)
- HALF stops required

## 📊 ORB COMPARISON TABLE

| ORB | Best RR | Best SL | Best Window | WR% | Avg R | Annual R | Trades/Week |
|-----|---------|---------|-------------|-----|-------|----------|-------------|
| **10AM** | **6R** | **FULL** | Extended | 16.4% | **+0.194R** | **50R** | **5** |
| **11AM** | **3R** | **HALF** | Extended | 28.1% | **+0.124R** | **32R** | **5** |
| **9AM** | 8R | HALF | Extended | 11.7% | +0.058R | 15R | 5 |

## 💡 WHY THEY'RE DIFFERENT

### 9AM (Asia Open)
- **First ORB of the day** → less conviction
- Needs **HALF stops** to avoid whipsaws
- Needs **high RR** (6R-8R) to overcome low WR
- Essentially a "coin flip with asymmetric payoff"

### 10AM (Mid-Asia)
- **1 hour into session** → direction established
- Uses **FULL stops** → more confident moves
- **Sweet spot RR: 4R-6R**
- Best overall performer

### 11AM (Late Asia)
- **2 hours into session** → moves mature
- Back to **HALF stops** → tighter management
- **Lower RR targets** (2R-4R) work better
- Highest win rate (28%)
- Moves are smaller but more reliable

## 🎯 OPTIMAL TRADING STRATEGY

### Option 1: TRADE ALL THREE (Diversified)

**9AM**: Skip (or only take filtered)
**10AM**: 6R FULL extended (primary)
**11AM**: 3R HALF extended (secondary)

**Expected**:
- 10AM: 258 trades/year, +50R
- 11AM: 258 trades/year, +32R
- **TOTAL: +82R per year with 516 trades (10/week)**

### Option 2: FOCUS ON 10AM ONLY (Concentrated)

**10AM**: 6R FULL extended

**Expected**:
- 258 trades/year (5/week)
- +50R per year
- 16.4% WR

### Option 3: HIGH WIN RATE APPROACH

**11AM**: 3R HALF extended

**Expected**:
- 258 trades/year (5/week)
- +32R per year
- 28% WR (more wins, easier psychologically)

## 🚀 WITH FILTERS (From Previous Analysis)

### 10AM with Pre-ORB Trend Filter

- Baseline: 258 trades/year, 16.4% WR, +50R/year
- **Filtered**: 114 trades/year, 24.7% WR, +93R/year
- **87% more profit with 56% fewer trades**

### 11AM Potential Filters (Not yet tested)

Likely to work:
- ORB size filter (0.12-0.25%)
- Pre-ORB trend (10am-11am bias)
- With 9am+10am alignment

---

## 📈 TRADE FREQUENCY BREAKDOWN

**Without filters:**
- Each ORB triggers ~258 trades per year
- That's **5 trades per week per ORB**
- Running all 3 = **15 trades per week**
- **This is PLENTY of action**

**With filters:**
- 10AM filtered: ~114 trades/year = **2 per week**
- 11AM filtered (estimated): ~130 trades/year = **2.5 per week**
- Combined: **4-5 trades per week** (much more manageable)

---

## ✅ RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION

### START HERE (Best Balance):

**10AM 6R FULL extended** (unfiltered for now)
- 5 trades per week
- +50R per year
- 16.4% WR

This gives you:
- Good trade frequency (not too much, not too little)
- Best profit potential
- Real-world testable in paper trading

### THEN ADD:

**11AM 3R HALF extended** (once comfortable with 10am)
- Another 5 trades per week
- +32R per year
- 28% WR (easier to trade - higher WR)

Combined: **10 trades per week, +82R per year**

### LATER:

Add pre-ORB trend filter to 10AM
- Cuts trades to 2/week
- Nearly doubles profit to +93R/year

## 🚨 CRITICAL NOTES

1. **These results are based on 2 years of MGC data** (2024-2026)
   - Solid sample size (520+ trades per setup)
   - But not 10 years of data
   - Continue tracking to validate

2. **Win rates are LOW for high RR setups**
   - 10AM 6R: only 16.4% WR (1 in 6)
   - You WILL have 10+ losing streaks
   - This is NORMAL

3. **Slippage not included**
   - Real trading will degrade by ~0.05-0.1R per trade
   - Still profitable but plan for it

4. **No position sizing guidance here**
   - Risk same amount per trade
   - Never risk more than 1-2% account per trade

---

## 📊 NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ Backtests complete (9am, 10am, 11am)
2. ✅ Filters identified for 10am
3. ⏭️ Test filters on 11am
4. ⏭️ Add setups to validated_setups database
5. ⏭️ Update trading app with filters
6. ⏭️ Paper trade for 2-4 weeks
7. ⏭️ Go live with small size

---

## CONCLUSION

**10AM is your money-maker (50R/year).**
**11AM is your consistency-builder (32R/year, 28% WR).**
**9AM is optional (15R/year).**

**Trade frequency: 5-10 setups per week unfiltered, 2-5 per week filtered.**

**This is PLENTY for an active trader.**
