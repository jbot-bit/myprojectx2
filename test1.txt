Proceed to PHASE 1 — FINDING.

Rules:
- Use ONLY the legitimate logic identified in PHASE 0:
  - Extended-window ORBs
  - Session transitions
  - Liquidity sweep → delayed resolution
  - Directional bias system
  - EDE validation pipeline
- Do NOT invent new concepts.
- Search for NEW edges by REUSING this structure:
  - Other sessions
  - Other instruments
  - Other stop/hold variants
- Output ONLY candidate edges with:
  - Clear hypothesis
  - Why it should exist structurally
  - What conditions it depends on

STOP before backtesting.
