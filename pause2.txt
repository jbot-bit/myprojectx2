Looks good. Two tweaks before you implement:

Don’t treat research/ as runtime. Keep research outputs there, but generate a runtime catalog to something like trading_app/data/edge_catalog.json (or data/edge_catalog.json).

Make the catalog support multiple conditions per edge (list of {type,value}) even if Phase 1B is single-condition right now.

Then implement:

a small script that builds the runtime catalog from research/phase1B_condition_edges.csv (+ baseline stats)

market_state.py + edge_matcher.py as pure modules

minimal integration that displays “Active edges” and “Potential edges” without changing execution logic.

Keep diffs small and stop after it runs and shows the output.

Also: if you find you need to touch core engine/db/strategy logic, stop and ask me first. And add a simple on/off toggle (feature flag) so this new catalog-driven view can be disabled without removing code
