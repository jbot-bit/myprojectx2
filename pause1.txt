I want to take what we discovered in Phase 1A/1B and make it usable by the app without locking anything in.

The goal is not to hard-code “best setups”, but to teach the app how to:
– understand the current market state
– know which edges become relevant in that state
– surface both active setups and potential setups depending on what could happen next

Please think in layers, not rules.

I want a clean separation between:

Market state detection (e.g. where price is relative to Asia range, session context, etc.)

Edge knowledge (what we learned from research: families + conditions + stats)

Live scanning / ranking (which edges are eligible right now or if X happens)

Very important constraints:
– Do not assume today’s dominant condition (asia_bias) is permanent. Treat it as just one state variable.
– The system must be able to accept new conditions later without refactoring.
– Keep execution logic untouched. This is selection and awareness, not trade mechanics.
– Keep research outputs as data, not code logic.

What I want you to do:
– Propose (and implement if appropriate) a single edge catalog format derived from the Phase 1B CSV that the app can read at runtime.
– Make the live system compute market state (e.g. ABOVE / BELOW / INSIDE Asia) and match edges whose conditions are satisfied.
– If the market is in a neutral state, show “potential setups” that would become eligible if price moves above or below key levels.

Keep the changes minimal and additive.
Don’t over-optimize. Don’t hard-wire assumptions.
Stop and show me the structure before going further.
