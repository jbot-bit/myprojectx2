Branch: restore-edge-pipeline

GOAL:
Take the Asia ORB research results (0900 / 1000 / 1100) and safely integrate them into the app so they are:
- Persisted
- Reproducible
- Zero-lookahead
- Promotion-gated

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- Do NOT write directly to validated_setups.
- Do NOT modify config.py.
- Do NOT assume research results are correct — verify before promotion.
- Use existing edge lifecycle: research → edge_candidates → approval → promotion.
- If anything is ambiguous, STOP and report.

TASK 1 — CONVERT RESEARCH → EDGE SPECS
From research/quick_asia outputs:
- Identify ONLY configs that are:
  - avg_r > 0
  - passed determinism + zero-lookahead
  - stable across splits (if available)

Create a structured spec for each viable edge:
- instrument (MGC)
- orb_time (0900 or 1000 only)
- entry rule
- stop rule (HALF or FULL)
- rr
- scan window
- exit rules (isolation vs continuation)
- filters used (if any)
- expected metrics (WR, avg_r, trades)

Write these to:
research/asia_edge_specs.json

TASK 2 — IMPORT INTO edge_candidates (DRAFT ONLY)
Using trading_app/edge_import.py:
- Import each spec as a new row in edge_candidates
- status = 'DRAFT'
- source = 'asia_orb_research'
- notes must include:
  - file path of source CSV
  - date range tested
  - determinism hash
  - isolation/continuation mode

Verify:
- No duplicates
- No overwrites
- No promotions

TASK 3 — SAFETY VERIFICATION
Before stopping:
- Query edge_candidates and list all new Asia edges
- Confirm:
  - sl_mode is correct per ORB
  - rr matches research
  - orb_time correct
- Run test_app_sync.py to confirm NOTHING in production changed

TASK 4 — WRITE A SHORT HANDOFF DOC
Create:
research/ASIA_READY_FOR_REVIEW.md

Include:
- Which Asia edges are viable
- Which are explicitly rejected (e.g. 1100)
- Clear recommendation:
  - Promote / Do not promote / Needs more testing

STOP AFTER TASK 4.
DO NOT PROMOTE ANY EDGE.
WAIT FOR USER CONFIRMATION.
