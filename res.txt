You are working inside an existing quantitative trading research codebase.

Your task is research only, not production. Do not modify any live trading logic, validated strategies, configuration files, or apps.

Goal: help me discover new statistically valid edges by adding derived research logic around session liquidity and ORB interactions.

What I want you to do conceptually:

Identify liquidity events (single-side sweep, dual-side sweep / cascade) relative to session highs/lows

Determine when the liquidity was taken (before, during, or after an ORB window)

Associate those liquidity events with subsequent ORB outcomes and direction

Constraints (very important):

Do NOT change database schemas or production tables

Do NOT touch validated strategies or configs

Treat this as an isolated research layer that can be thrown away

Prefer derived labels in memory or temporary research outputs

Keep logic deterministic, testable, and free of lookahead

What I want as output:

A clear conceptual breakdown of liquidity types and timing (plain English first)

A suggested research workflow for testing these edges safely

Optional: example pseudocode or high-level Python logic (not tightly coupled to any specific file structure)

Guidance on how to rank and decide which edges are strong enough to promote later

What I do NOT want:

No assumptions about my file paths

No large refactors

No “let’s just add this to production” shortcuts

No hard-coded constants unless justified

Think like a senior quant researcher helping another researcher explore liquidity-driven conditional edges, not like someone shipping features.

Ask clarifying questions only if absolutely necessary; otherwise proceed carefully and incrementally.
