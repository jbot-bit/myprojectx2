PHASE 2.5 — UNBLOCK MORE EDGES (MGC FAST PATH)

Goal:
Increase usable edges for MGC without lookahead.

PART A — Implement the 2 rewrites as NEW candidate specs (do not backtest yet)
1) Rewrite Edge 2 (0900 dependency):
   - Condition must use only break_dir availability:
     require orb_2300_break_dir = 'NONE' AND orb_0030_break_dir = 'NONE'
   - Then trade 0900 breakout normally.

2) Rewrite Edge 7 (0900→1000):
   - Condition must NOT use trade outcome.
   - Use: orb_0900_break_dir must equal orb_1000_break_dir, and orb_0900_break_dir != 'NONE'
   - Then trade 1000 breakout normally.

Deliver:
- Write both rewritten edges to: research/phase2_rewrites.md
- Ensure each edge has explicit timestamps and required fields list.

PART B — Generate more MGC candidates using ONLY proven-safe structures
Run a discovery batch for MGC across sessions:
- sessions: 1800, 2300, 0030, 1100, 0900, 1000
- allowed structures:
  - extended scan windows
  - ORB size normalized filters (percent of price)
  - 2-step sweep → rejection entries
  - directional_bias gating (must prove inputs are pre-entry)
- output: top 50 candidates into research outputs (CSV/JSON) with key metrics
- DO NOT promote to validated_setups
- DO NOT touch production DB except importing to edge_candidates as DRAFT via trading_app/edge_import.py

Stop after:
- Top-50 candidate report created
- Candidates imported as DRAFT into edge_candidates
- No approvals/promotions performed
