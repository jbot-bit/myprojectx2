Proceed to Phase 2 ONLY.

Build a deterministic Research Runner (NO LLM decisions).

Requirements:
1) Implement a CLI script:
   pipeline/run_edge_candidate.py --candidate-id N

2) The runner must:
   - Load the candidate from edge_candidates
   - Populate code_version (git commit hash)
   - Populate data_version (last candle ts or dataset fingerprint)
   - Use test_config_json to control test parameters
   - Run backtests using ONLY our existing DB tables/views and execution logic

3) Metrics to compute and write:
   - metrics_json: win_rate, avg_r, total_r, n_trades, max_dd
   - robustness_json:
       * walk-forward (at least 3 folds)
       * regime split (ATR high vs low OR trend up/down)
   - slippage_assumptions_json: 0/1/2 tick stress

4) After completion:
   - Update status from DRAFT → TESTED
   - Refuse to run if status is not DRAFT

5) Tests (pytest):
   - Candidate status becomes TESTED
   - metrics_json populated
   - robustness_json populated
   - Runner is deterministic (same inputs → same outputs)

Constraints:
- No changes to Trade Mode
- No AI usage
- Use canonical DB connection
- Stop and report after Phase 2

Deliverables:
- Script
- Supporting module(s)
- Tests
