# MGC Trading Playbook - V2 (Zero Lookahead)

**Based on 739 days of historical data (2024-01-02 to 2026-01-10)**

**Critical Philosophy: HONESTY OVER ACCURACY**

This playbook contains ONLY edges that are 100% reproducible in live trading. All analysis uses zero-lookahead methodology - we can only use information available AT the decision time, not future session outcomes.

**The V1 playbook (previous version) had lookahead bias and showed inflated win rates. This is the HONEST version.**

**✨ NEW:** Mobile Trading Hub with ML predictions now available! See [Using the Mobile App](#using-the-mobile-app-for-playbook-execution) below.

## Daily Workflow (HONEST VERSION)

### Morning Preparation (08:00-08:30 Brisbane Time)

1. **Update Data:**
   ```bash
   python daily_update.py
   ```

2. **Check PRE_ASIA Range:**
   ```bash
   python realtime_signals.py --time 0900
   ```
   - If PRE_ASIA > 50 ticks → 09:00 tradeable
   - If PRE_ASIA < 30 ticks → Skip 09:00

3. **Check Previous Day ORB Outcomes:**
   ```bash
   python query_features.py
   ```
   - Look at yesterday's 09:00, 10:00, 11:00 outcomes
   - Prepare for correlations

### During Trading Day

**09:00 ORB:** CONDITIONAL
- ✅ Trade IF PRE_ASIA > 50 ticks (52.7% WR, +0.05 R)
- ❌ Skip if PRE_ASIA < 30 ticks (40.4% WR, -0.19 R)

**10:00 ORB:** ✅ ALWAYS TRADE (Primary Edge)
- 10:00 UP baseline: 55.5% WR, +0.11 R
- If 09:00 was WIN → 10:00 UP: 57.9% WR, +0.16 R (increase confidence)

**11:00 ORB:** CONDITIONAL (Correlation-Based)
- ✅ Trade IF:
  - 09:00 WIN + 10:00 WIN → 11:00 UP (57.4% WR)
  - 09:00 LOSS + 10:00 WIN → 11:00 DOWN (57.7% WR)
  - PRE_ASIA > 50 ticks → 11:00 UP (55.1% WR)
- ❌ Skip otherwise

**18:00 ORB:** ✅ TRADEABLE
- Baseline: 51.8% WR, +0.04 R
- If PRE_LONDON > 40 ticks → Favor DOWN (53.9% WR, +0.08 R)

**23:00 ORB:** ❌ AVOID
- Overall: 48.7% WR, -0.03 R

**00:30 ORB:** ❌ AVOID
- Overall: 48.6% WR, -0.03 R
- Even with filters, edge is marginal

### End of Day Review

1. **Record ORB Outcomes:**
   ```bash
   python journal.py
   ```
   - Log 09:00, 10:00, 11:00 outcomes for tomorrow's correlations

2. **Check Edge Stability:**
   ```bash
   python analyze_edge_stability.py --orb 1000 --dir UP
   ```

## Risk Management Rules

### Position Sizing (Based on HONEST Win Rates)

**High Confidence Setups** (55-58% WR):
- 10:00 UP (especially after 09:00 WIN)
- 11:00 UP after 09:00 WIN + 10:00 WIN
- 11:00 DOWN after 09:00 LOSS + 10:00 WIN
- Risk: 1.0-1.5% of account

**Medium Confidence Setups** (51-55% WR):
- 10:00 UP baseline
- 11:00 UP + PRE_ASIA > 50 ticks
- 18:00 baseline
- Risk: 0.5-1.0% of account

**Low Confidence / Skip** (<51% WR or negative Avg R):
- Everything else

### Entry Rules

- **CRITICAL**: Wait for FIRST 1-MINUTE BAR to CLOSE outside ORB range (NOT 5-minute close!)
- Entry = Close of breakout bar (1-minute close price)
- ORB range = High and Low of the 5-minute window (e.g., 10:00-10:05)
- Confirmation: 1 consecutive 1-minute close required (close_confirmations=1)

### Stop Loss

- Stop = Opposite side of ORB range
- 1R = ORB size (distance from entry to stop)

### Target

- **Realistic expectation:** +0.05 to +0.16 R average
- Scale out at +1R (take profit on half position)
- Let remainder run to +2R or session high/low
- **DO NOT expect 2:1 or 3:1 RR on every trade** - the edge is in win rate, not RR

### Maximum Daily Trades

- **Focus:** 10:00 ORB primary, 11:00 ORB secondary, 18:00 ORB tertiary
- **Maximum:** 2-3 ORBs per day
- **Reality:** Most days you'll only have 1-2 valid setups

## What Changed from V1 Playbook

### V1 (Lookahead Bias - INVALID)

- **11:00 UP:** 57.9% WR, +0.16 R (filtered by Asia EXPANDED)
- **18:00 UP:** 56.9% WR, +0.14 R (filtered by session types)
- **Problem:** Session types not known until AFTER the session closes

### V2 (Zero Lookahead - HONEST)

- **10:00 UP:** 55.5% WR, +0.11 R (no filters needed)
- **10:00 UP after 09:00 WIN:** 57.9% WR, +0.16 R (correlation-based)
- **11:00 needs filters:** PRE_ASIA or ORB correlations
- **Key:** Use PRE blocks and completed ORB outcomes, not future session types

**The win rates are LOWER, but they're REAL and TRADEABLE.**

---

## Setups to AVOID (Negative Expectancy)

1. **09:00 ORB with PRE_ASIA < 30 ticks** (40.4% WR, -0.19 R)
2. **10:00 DOWN** (47.3% WR, -0.07 R)
3. **23:00 ORB in general** (48.7% WR, -0.03 R)
4. **00:30 ORB in general** (48.6% WR, -0.03 R)
5. **11:00 UP after 09:00 LOSS + 10:00 WIN** (43.9% WR, -0.12 R)

## Notes and Disclaimers

1. **These are HONEST numbers with ZERO LOOKAHEAD**
   - V1 playbook had inflated win rates due to lookahead bias
   - These win rates are LOWER but 100% reproducible in live trading

2. **Sample sizes matter**
   - Setups with <50 trades: LOW confidence
   - Setups with 100+ trades: HIGH confidence
   - Best setups have 200+ trades

3. **Edge is SMALL but REAL**
   - Avg R of +0.05 to +0.16 is typical
   - Don't expect 2:1 or 3:1 RR on most trades
   - Win rate edge (55-58%) is more important than RR

4. **This is a DISCRETIONARY system**
   - Requires judgment, market context, news awareness
   - Rules are guidelines, not gospel
   - Track your own performance

5. **Markets change**
   - Re-run analyze_orb_v2.py monthly
   - Monitor edge stability with analyze_edge_stability.py
   - Be prepared to adapt

6. **Focus on PROCESS, not RESULTS**
   - Follow the rules even during losing streaks
   - 55% WR means 45% of trades will lose (almost half!)
   - Edge plays out over 100+ trades, not 10 trades

### ML Integration (Shadow Mode)

**How ML Enhances the Playbook:**

The mobile app includes ML predictions trained on 740 days of MGC data:
- **Directional bias**: Predicts UP/DOWN/NONE with confidence (55-60% accuracy)
- **Expected R**: Estimates expected R-multiple for the setup
- **Shadow mode**: ML enhances confidence but doesn't override playbook rules

**When to Use ML:**

1. **10:00 ORB UP** - Check ML confidence:
   - ML says UP with >60% confidence → Increase size to 1.5%
   - ML says UP with 50-60% confidence → Standard size 1.0%
   - ML says DOWN → Reduce size to 0.5% or skip

2. **11:00 ORB** - Use ML for tie-breaking:
   - Multiple setups valid → Follow ML direction
   - Unclear correlation pattern → ML provides context

3. **1100 ORB** - Directional Bias feature:
   - Analyzes market structure
   - Predicts which way ORB will break
   - Shows confidence percentage
   - Helps focus preparation

**ML Limitations:**
- Not perfect (55-60% accuracy)
- Sometimes unavailable (no active setup)
- Should enhance, not replace, playbook rules
- Best used as confirmation, not primary signal

### Playbook + Mobile App Workflow

**Morning (08:00-09:00):**
```
1. Launch mobile app (START_MOBILE_APP.bat)
2. Check Dashboard card:
   - Current ATR
   - Upcoming ORBs
   - Setup Scanner results
3. Review Safety Status (must be ✅ SAFE)
4. Check ML predictions for today's setups
5. Plan which ORBs to trade based on playbook rules
```

**During 10:00 ORB (Best Setup):**
```
1. Dashboard shows "PREPARE" at 09:55
2. Check ML insights:
   - Direction: 🚀 UP
   - Confidence: 68%
   - Expected R: +0.15
3. Swipe to Chart → Watch ORB form (10:00-10:05)
4. ORB forms → Swipe to Trade Calculator
5. Enter ORB high/low → Calculate levels
6. Check if 09:00 was WIN (correlation boost to 57.9% WR)
7. Enter trade → Swipe to Positions → Monitor P&L
```

**Questions During Trading:**
```
1. Swipe to AI Chat card
2. Ask: "Should I take this 10:00 DOWN setup?"
3. AI responds with playbook context (47.3% WR, -0.07 R, avoid)
4. Ask: "Why is 10:00 UP better than DOWN?"
5. AI explains historical edge
```

### Combining Playbook Rules + ML + Mobile App

**Decision Framework:**

1. **Start with Playbook Rules** (highest priority):
   - Is this ORB time tradeable? (10:00, 18:00 yes; others conditional)
   - Does PRE block filter pass?
   - Do ORB correlations support this direction?

2. **Check Safety Status** (must pass):
   - Data quality ✓
   - Market hours ✓
   - Risk limits ✓

3. **Use ML as Confidence Adjustment**:
   - ML agrees with playbook → Increase size 20-50%
   - ML neutral → Standard size
   - ML disagrees → Reduce size 50% or skip

4. **Execute via Mobile Interface**:
   - Dashboard: Monitor countdown + filter
   - Chart: Watch ORB formation
   - Trade Calc: Get levels instantly
   - Positions: Track P&L in real-time
   - AI Chat: Ask questions anytime

**Example Decision:**

**Setup**: 10:00 ORB at 10:05
- ORB: 2700-2706 (6pts)
- ATR: 40pts
- PRE_ASIA: 60 ticks (>50 ✓)
- 09:00 outcome: WIN ✓
- Breakout direction: UP

**Playbook says:**
- 10:00 UP baseline: 55.5% WR, +0.11 R
- 10:00 UP after 09:00 WIN: 57.9% WR, +0.16 R
- **Action**: TRADE with high confidence

**ML says:**
- Direction: 🚀 UP
- Confidence: 72%
- Expected R: +0.18

**Final Decision:**
- Playbook + ML both agree → **STRONG TRADE**
- Position size: 1.5% (increased confidence)
- Enter via Trade Calculator
- Monitor via Positions card

---

## Honesty Statement

**This system will NOT make you rich quickly.**

**Realistic expectations:**
- 55% win rate with +0.11 R average = Slow, steady growth
- You will have losing days, losing weeks, even losing months
- Max drawdown historically: -31R to -40R (depending on ORB)
- Recovery is slow

**But it is HONEST and TRADEABLE:**
- Every edge shown is 100% reproducible live
- No fantasy, no curve-fitting, no lookahead
- You can actually execute these trades in real-time
- This is the foundation for consistent profitability

**Trade small, be patient, focus on process.**
