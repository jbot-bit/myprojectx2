STEP 3.4 — ADVERSARIAL / ATTACK TESTING

(Break it on purpose. If it survives, it’s real.)

I’ll give concrete attacks + pass/fail rules.
No optimisation. Observation only.

3.4.1 Slippage Shock Tests

Attack

Inject slippage by regime:

Normal: +1 tick

Volatile: +3–5 ticks

Extreme: +8–12 ticks (tail events)

Apply to

Entry

Stop

Target (worst-case)

Pass

Edge stays > 0R in Normal

Degrades but doesn’t invert in Volatile

Loss bounded in Extreme

3.4.2 Spread Widening / Liquidity Vacuum

Attack

Artificially widen bid/ask during:

ORB break candle

Retest candle

Randomly reject fills if spread > X ticks

Pass

Strategy still trades selectively

Trade count drops (expected)

No explosion in loss per trade

3.4.3 Ambiguous Candle Resolution (Stop-First Bias)

Attack

If a candle hits both stop & target:

Force STOP first

Or force WORST of next candle

Pass

Expectancy decreases but remains positive

No reliance on optimistic fills

3.4.4 Delayed Signal / Latency Injection

Attack

Delay entry by:

+1 candle

+2 candles

Recompute stop & target from delayed entry

Pass

Edge survives +1 candle

+2 candle likely degrades (acceptable)

No catastrophic inversion

3.4.5 Partial Data / Missed Bar Simulation

Attack

Randomly remove:

1 candle from ORB window

1 candle after breakout

Or delay candle arrival by 1 minute

Pass

System either:

Skips trade safely, or

Trades with reduced size

Never trades on incomplete ORB unknowingly

3.4.6 Trade Skipping Stress

Attack

Randomly skip:

10%

20%

30% of valid trades

Purpose

Simulates human hesitation, platform outages, copier failure

Pass

Equity curve shape remains similar

No “one-trade dependency”

3.4.7 Capital & Risk Attack (Realism)

Attack

Enforce:

Max 1 trade per ORB

STEP 3.5 — PAPER vs LIVE RECONCILIATION

Requirement

Every paper trade logs:

Signal time

Entry sent time

Fill time

Fill price

Slippage vs model

Weekly Test

Compare:

Expected R vs Realised R

Expected win rate vs Actual

Rejection rate vs Model

Fail Conditions

Persistent negative slippage drift

Fill quality worse than “Realistic” model

Structural mismatch (e.g. late fills always losing)

STEP 3 OUTPUT (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You finish Step 3 only if you have:

✅ Attack matrix results

✅ Worst-case expectancy table

✅ Paper vs model delta report

✅ Clear “do not trade if X” conditions

Max 2 concurrent trades

Daily max loss (e.g. −3R)

Force shutdown on breach

Pass

Strategy still profitable over sample

Drawdown capped

No martingale behaviour
