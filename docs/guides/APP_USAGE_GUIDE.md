# App Usage Guide - Which App to Use

**Date**: 2026-01-18 (renamed from SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md for clarity)
**Purpose**: Guide to which trading apps to use and how to use them

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: TWO VALID APPS (Desktop + Mobile)

**DESKTOP APP (Tabs Interface):**
```
trading_app/app_trading_hub.py
```
- Launch: `START_TRADING_APP.bat` or `streamlit run trading_app/app_trading_hub.py`
- URL: http://localhost:8501
- Best for: Desktop/laptop screens

**MOBILE APP (Tinder Cards Interface):**
```
trading_app/app_mobile.py
```
- Launch: `START_MOBILE_APP.bat` or `streamlit run trading_app/app_mobile.py`
- URL: http://localhost:8501
- Best for: Phones (swipeable cards)
- Android APK: `app-debug.apk` (wraps this URL)

**Choose based on your device. Both apps access the same database and logic.**

---

## ❌ DO NOT USE THESE (ARCHIVED)

These apps are OLD and INCOMPLETE:
- ~~unified_trading_app.py~~ (archived to _archive/)
- ~~trading_app_decision_focused.py~~ (archived to _archive/)

**If you see any other .py files in the root claiming to be a "trading app", DO NOT USE THEM.**

---

## What's In The Production App

**trading_app/app_trading_hub.py** has EVERYTHING:

### Tabs:
1. **🔴 LIVE** - Real-time strategy evaluation with strategy engine
2. **📡 SETUP SCANNER** - All 17 setups (MGC/NQ/MPL) monitored simultaneously
3. **📍 LEVELS** - Key price levels and support/resistance
4. **📋 TRADE PLAN** - Entry/stop/target calculations
5. **📖 JOURNAL** - Trade logging and performance tracking
6. **🤖 AI CHAT** - Claude Sonnet 4.5 with memory

### Professional Features:
- ✅ **Alert System** - Audio + desktop notifications
- ✅ **Risk Manager** - Position sizing and daily loss limits
- ✅ **Position Tracker** - Open positions and P&L tracking
- ✅ **Data Quality Monitor** - Real-time data health checks
- ✅ **Market Hours Monitor** - Session timing and status
- ✅ **Directional Bias Detector** - ML-based direction prediction (1100 ORB)
- ✅ **Enhanced Charting** - ORB overlays and trade markers

### Data Source:
- ✅ **Uses validated_setups** table from data/db/gold.db
- ✅ **Synced with config.py** (verified by test_app_sync.py)
- ✅ **17 profitable setups** with correct RR, SL modes, and filters
- ✅ **Tier system** (S+, S, A, B, C) with automatic risk adjustment

### Critical Features:
- ✅ **Correct target calculation** - Uses actual RR from setup (not always 1R)
- ✅ **Tier-based risk** - S+=0.50%, A=0.50%, B/C=0.10-0.25%
- ✅ **Configurable account size** - Set your account size in sidebar
- ✅ **AI assistant with memory** - Remembers your trading history

## Why Only Two Apps?

**Problems with more than two apps:**
1. ❌ Risk of using wrong version with bugs
2. ❌ Confusion about which one has latest fixes
3. ❌ Wasted time fixing same bug in multiple places
4. ❌ Data inconsistency between apps
5. ❌ Impossible to maintain quality

**Solution:**
- ✅ Two apps only (desktop + mobile)
- ✅ Clear device-based choice
- ✅ One shared database and logic
- ✅ No confusion, no mistakes

## Verification Checklist

Before trading with the app, verify:

1. ✅ Launch with START_TRADING_APP.bat
2. ✅ Opens at http://localhost:8501
3. ✅ See 6 tabs: LIVE, SCANNER, LEVELS, TRADE PLAN, JOURNAL, AI CHAT
4. ✅ Run `python test_app_sync.py` - ALL TESTS PASS
5. ✅ Check sidebar - can set account size
6. ✅ Check SCANNER tab - shows all 17 setups
7. ✅ Check AI CHAT tab - Claude Sonnet 4.5 ready

---

## When Making Changes

**ALWAYS:**
1. Edit `trading_app/app_trading_hub.py` (or its supporting modules in trading_app/)
2. Run `python test_app_sync.py` after any database/config changes
3. Test the changes in the running app
4. Document changes in ENHANCEMENTS_COMPLETE.md

**NEVER:**
1. Create new app files in root directory
2. Edit files in _archive/
3. Make copies of app_trading_hub.py
4. Skip running test_app_sync.py

---

## Emergency: If App Won't Start

1. Check if port 8501 is in use:
   ```bash
   netstat -ano | findstr :8501
   ```

2. Kill the process:
   ```bash
   taskkill /F /PID <pid_number>
   ```

3. Relaunch:
   ```bash
   START_TRADING_APP.bat
   ```

## Questions?

Ask the AI assistant in the app! (🤖 AI CHAT tab)

---

## 🔒 AI Source Lock (Critical Safety Feature)

**Date Added**: 2026-01-19
**Purpose**: Ensure the AI assistant can ONLY use database + engine outputs (never general trading knowledge)

### What Is AI Source Lock?

The AI assistant in the app is **CODE-ENFORCED** to answer ONLY using:
1. Data from `data/db/gold.db` (bars_1m, bars_5m, daily_features_v2, validated_setups)
2. Outputs from `strategy_engine.py` and `execution_engine.py`
3. Nothing else (no general trading advice, no external knowledge, no estimating)

### How It Works

**Single Choke Point**:
```
trading_app/ai_guard.py → guarded_chat_answer()
```
- ALL AI calls must go through this function
- NO other file can call the Anthropic API directly
- Evidence Pack is MANDATORY (no evidence = no answer)

**Evidence Pack**: Contains:
- Instrument, timeframe, data tables used
- Strategy engine evaluation (ENTER or WAIT)
- Validated setups from database
- Current price, ORB data, session levels
- Atomic facts derived ONLY from our data

**Fail-Closed Gates**:
1. No Evidence Pack → REFUSE
2. Missing required fields → REFUSE
3. Trade question but engine status != ENTER → REFUSE ("NO TRADE (WAIT)")
4. Missing entry/stop/target prices → REFUSE

### Why This Matters

**WITHOUT AI Source Lock**:
- ❌ AI could use general trading knowledge (unreliable)
- ❌ AI could infer missing values (dangerous)
- ❌ AI could recommend trades not approved by our engine
- ❌ REAL MONEY LOSSES from bad advice

**WITH AI Source Lock**:
- ✅ AI can ONLY use our database + engine outputs
- ✅ AI cannot recommend trades unless engine says "ENTER"
- ✅ AI cannot estimate or infer missing data
- ✅ AI refuses to answer if data is incomplete
- ✅ SAFE for live trading decisions

### Verification

**Run tests to verify lock cannot be bypassed**:
```bash
pytest tests/test_ai_source_lock.py -v
```

**Tests check**:
1. ✅ No files call Anthropic API directly (AST scan)
2. ✅ LOCKED_SYSTEM_PROMPT.txt exists and enforces rules
3. ✅ No Evidence Pack → refused (without calling model)
4. ✅ Missing fields → refused
5. ✅ WAIT signal → refuses trade recommendation
6. ✅ Empty candles → refused
7. ✅ ENTER signal with complete data → allowed

**All tests must pass before using the AI assistant for trading decisions.**

### Files Involved

```
trading_app/
├── ai_guard.py                           ← THE ONLY CHOKE POINT ⭐
├── prompts/LOCKED_SYSTEM_PROMPT.txt      ← AI instructions (fail-closed)
├── ai_assistant.py                       ← Refactored to use ai_guard
└── ai_memory.py                          ← Conversation memory

tests/
└── test_ai_source_lock.py                ← Enforcement tests
```

### Audit Trail

Every AI response is logged with:
- Evidence pack summary (instrument, status, facts count)
- User question
- AI response
- Timestamp

Check logs for replayability and proof of "no outside knowledge".

### How to Update

**If you modify the AI system**:
1. Edit ONLY `ai_guard.py` or `LOCKED_SYSTEM_PROMPT.txt`
2. Run `pytest tests/test_ai_source_lock.py -v`
3. ALL TESTS MUST PASS
4. Never bypass the guard (code gates + tests prevent this)

**NEVER**:
- Import Anthropic client outside ai_guard.py
- Call .messages.create() directly
- Skip evidence pack validation
- Allow AI to answer without data

**Remember: ONE app. ONE source of truth. No confusion. No mistakes.**

**🎯 trading_app/app_trading_hub.py is THE ONLY WAY.**
