You’re auditing a newly discovered trading edge.

Goal: determine if it’s real and zero-lookahead, not to improve it.

Rules:

Do NOT touch production logic, configs, validated_setups, apps, or DB schemas

Research-only, smallest possible diff

Be adversarial: assume the edge might be invalid

What to do:

Identify exactly how the ELITE setup eligibility is computed.

Recompute eligibility at each historical trade time using only data available at that moment (time-travel check).

Flag any use of future/session-complete/EOD information.

Run 2–3 light robustness checks (walk-forward split, label shuffle, small threshold perturbation).

Output (keep it brief):

PASS / FAIL on lookahead safety

Evidence for the verdict (numbers, not prose)

If FAIL: exact leakage source and smallest fix (research-only)

Avoid large tables. Summaries only.
