I want to clean this up and lock in truth:

1) Delete v1 completely

Remove pipeline/build_daily_features.py (v1) and any related v1 helpers/usages.

Ensure nothing references daily_features anywhere.

2) Lock the system to v2

Make daily_features_v2 the only accepted features table.

Add a hard guard: if any code tries to query/create/use daily_features (v1), it should fail loudly with a clear error.

Update any scripts/tools that still point at v1 to use v2.

3) Update docs (truth-first)

Update README (and any “system guide” docs) to state plainly:

daily_features_v2 is canonical

timezone handling expectations (UTC storage, Brisbane-local session logic)

ORB definition: 5-min window + 1-min close confirmation

how to run audits/tests

4) Verify integrity

Run: pytest -q and python test_app_sync.py and paste the one-line summaries.

5) Then research mode (more strategies)

Run a new scan/backtest pass to discover additional profitable ORB families and single-condition improvements (don’t pigeon-hole to just Asia).

Output a ranked CSV + a short MD report with: trades/year, avg R, total R, max DD, stability splits.

Keep diffs minimal, no refactors unless needed for v1 removal + v2 lock.
