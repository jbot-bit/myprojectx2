Let’s do focused, honest strategy discovery.

I want to run a small, trustworthy baseline study using the fixed Unicorn runner.

Scope:

Session: 18:00 ORB only

ORB window: 5 minutes

Entry: 1-minute close breakout

Data source: bars_1m + daily_features_v2 only

Parameters to test:

RR values: 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0

SL modes: FULL and HALF

Rules:

Use unicorn_backtest_runner_fixed.py

Do not reuse any old results or meta scans

Keep this research-only

No combinatorial scans, no indicators, no filters yet

Output:

One clear table summarising results

Enough detail to decide which RR/SL combinations are viable at 18:00

Stop once baseline results are produced. Don’t optimize or expand yet.

That’s it.
Nothing else.
