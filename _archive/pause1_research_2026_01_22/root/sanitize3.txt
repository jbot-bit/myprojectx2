Step 1
Take docs/UNICORN_SETUPS_CORRECTED.md and convert every setup into a structured config file (JSON preferred) that my research/backtest runner can consume.
Each setup must include: instrument, orb_time, orb_window_minutes=5, entry_rule=1m_close_confirm, rr, sl_mode (FULL/HALF), scan_end_rule (next_asia_open_0900), and any filters (ATR caps, ORB size caps).
Do not change strategy logic yet—just produce the catalog file and a short mapping table from markdown section → config id.

Step 2
Using the new unicorn catalog JSON, add a single research runner script that backtests every config and produces:
research/unicorn_scan_results.csv and a short research/unicorn_scan_results.md ranking top setups.
Use the canonical backtest engine and daily_features_v2.
Keep it research-only (no app integration).
Then run pytest -q and python test_app_sync.py and paste summaries.
