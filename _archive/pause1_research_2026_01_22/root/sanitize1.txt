I don’t trust that v1 or v2 is “correct” by default.
I want the system to prove which one is accurate, and only then standardise.

Please audit both daily_features v1 and v2 end-to-end:

what inputs they use

how ORBs are calculated

what assumptions differ (timezones, session windows, pre-entry data, etc.)

whether either version has lookahead, leakage, or silent inconsistencies

I want a side-by-side comparison on the same sample of days:

recompute ORBs directly from bars_1m

compare against v1 outputs

compare against v2 outputs

highlight mismatches with concrete examples (timestamps, prices)

If v2 is demonstrably better:

mark v1 as deprecated

ensure nothing in the app or research can silently use v1

recompute any affected backtests or stats so everything is consistent

If v1 is better or v2 has flaws:

explain exactly why

fix v2 or recommend a clean v3

The priority is honesty and accuracy, not speed or convenience.
Don’t refactor the app unless a mismatch is proven.
Deliver a clear report showing evidence, not conclusions.

Treat this like validating a financial system — if the data is wrong, everything else is useless.
