DECISION: Phase 2 is the current source of truth.

Reason:
Phase 4A extended-window backtest is INVALID due to a confirmed midnight rollover bug.
Entries fire at 00:00 with wrong ORB reference, corrupting results.

Instructions:
1. Discard Phase 4A results.
2. Treat Phase 2 results for:
   - 2300 ORB extended
   - 0030 ORB extended
   as provisionally approved research.
3. Do NOT attempt further large scans.
4. If fixing backtest:
   - ONLY fix trading-day boundary + entry detection
   - Re-test ONLY 2300/0030 extended
5. No changes to validated_setups or config.py unless explicitly approved.

Goal:
Stabilize system, preserve valid edges, avoid analysis paralysis.
